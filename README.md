# Fuse iOS Foreign Code Basics Example
Example project to accompany the "[iOS Foreign Code Basics](https://youtu.be/Th0V2p7EmXw)" Fuse tutorial video. This is a super simple app that uses foreign code to play a system sound on iOS devices.

## Fuse version
This example was produced with Fuse (beta) v0.9.11 (build 5893).

## Branches
The "finished product" is on the `master` branch, and the template I started with in the video is on the `starting-template` branch.
